Revision history for Perl extension Whim

{{$NEXT}}

1.2020.07.19.1 2020-07-19T15:46:13Z

    - `whim send` now keeps you appraised of its activity and progress
    when run in single-argument mode.

    - Removing the ill-considered and untested `--entry` option for
    `whim send` and replacing with with a not-untested and
    less-ill-considered `--content` one.

1.2020.07.19.0 2020-07-19T14:07:01Z

    - The one-argument form of the `whim send` command will now attempt
    to send webmentions at every valid target on the source document, no
    longer limiting itself to those found within certain microformats. A
    new command-line option allows you to instead limit it to targets
    within the first h-entry microformat.

1.2020.07.12.0 2020-07-12T17:40:10Z

    - Stored webmentions now set themselves as requiring a re-check,
    possibly for updated (or deleted) content, on receipt of an
    identical copy.

    - Adding a `/summarize_wms` endpoint, with an associated template
    and new images.
