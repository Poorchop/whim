=head1 Whim

Whim is a command-line utility for sending, receiving, and working with L<webmentions|https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/>.

Notable features (both real and I<graspably aspirational>) include:

=over

=item *

A daemon to receive and store incoming webmentions



=item *

A webmention verifier, suitable for scheduled operation



=item *

A tool for sending webmentions, individually or en masse (given a source URL)



=item *

Commands to query a local database of received webmentions, with both JSON and human-readable output modes



=item *

A simple webserver to display webmention-powered comment sections as HTML, suitable for JavaScript-driven insertion into an otherwise static webpage

=head2 Not really usable yet (but webmention.io is)

I<This software is pre-alpha> and has no documentation, incomplete test coverage, and inflexible configuration. I hope to continue improving this work over the course of 2020. L<See the project's Issues tracker for ongoing status updates.|https://github.com/jmacdotorg/whim/milestone/1>

B<If you want to start receiving webmentions right now>, please check out Aaron Parecki's most excellent L<Webmention.io|https://webmention.io>, a free hosted service that you can start using right away, with any web page. (It is also an open-source project.)

B<If you are still curious about Whim>, by all means check it out and L<give me a holler|mailto:jmac@jmac.org> if you'd like. I'd be happy to answer any questions about this project or L<my other IndieWeb work|https://indieweb.org/User:Jmac.org>.

You may also wish to join the L<#whim channel on Freenode IRC|http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23whim>, where I am likely idling but listening as C<jmac>.


=head2 Building and testing whim locally

Use the CPAN or L<App::cpanminus|https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus> tools to install dependencies.

 shell-session
 $ cpanm --installdeps --with-develop .


And C<prove> for the tests!

 shell-session
 $ prove -l t/ xt/
 â‹®
 Result: PASS



=head2 Running whim

The C<whim> executable accepts the following subcommands. Some fine day, they may actually have documentation.

=over

=item *

C<daemon>: Run a daemon that listens for incoming webmentions and stores them in a local database



=item *

C<send>: Send a webmention



=item *

C<query>: Query a local database for stored webmentions meeting given criteria

=head2 "Whim"?

Two possible explanations:

=over

=item 1.

It stands for L<B<whi>B<m>atter|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter>, the connective tissue betweeen separate neurological structures in the human brain. Its function resembles Webmention's role in allowing independent websites to communicate, and thus helping their respective authors to collaborate.



=item 2.

Whim puts the I<hi!> in B<w>ebB<m>entions.
